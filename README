Czip comes with a copy of all of the necessary files from zlib plus zipinfo.h, 
mypigz15.c, ppezip.c and a makefiles for both the ppe and the spe. To setup 
czip, all you have to do is cd into the ppu directory and type make. It will 
create a czip executable in that directory. Once the file is compiled you can 
move the file into the /user/local/bin or /bin directories and then you will 
be able to just type in czip, the -jn flag where n is the number of spes you 
wish to use, and the file path of the file that you want to compress. If you 
don't enter any options, 8 spes will be assumed.

There is also a man page included. To set that up all you have to do is move 
the file czip.1.gz to the folder /usr/share/man/man1/ and your done.

Version 1.1 is fully functioning. It has some enhancements that put the file 
name in the header and the correct file size of the compressed file at the 
end. In this version, there is only one header and trailer. The file compression 
ratio is also improved as a result.
